# Hacking Minecraft

## Chapter 0x00 - Introduction

First things first: this is hacking, not modding, and this is hacking, not cracking.

Modding Minecraft is a lot of fun, holds a lot of potential, and there is a robust community of Minecraft modders, offering a veritable universe of possibilities for programming challenges and fun game play.  I've done a little bit of modding m'self, and as you will see soon, the decompiled sources maintained by MCP are a key resource in my pursuit of Minecraft hacking.  The distinction I make, however, is that by "hacking" in this blog series I mean (1) directly modifying the Minecraft engine, without the benefit (nor the drawbacks!) of a mod hooking mechanism, and (2) working directly in Java bytecode.  Though later in this series I employ Java source-to-bytecode compilation to ease one of the steps, it comes back to tinkering with the classfile bytecode to implement the changes.

And, by "hacking", I am using the older, original sense of "hacking", meaning tinkering to improve or adapt for suitability to a particular purpose.  Those of us who use "hacking" in this sense refer to computer break-ins, vandalism, privicy invasion, and other cyberattacks as "cracking".  It's an uphill battle, though, since most news and other media outlets use the word "hacking" for these kinds of neferious activities.  But, at the same time, the web is full of blogs and vlogs on how to "hack your life" or "hack your food".  Certainly, these uses of the term don't mean anything nefarious.  Computer hacking used to be the same way; the quintessential example would be the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club](Homebrew Computer Club).  So, in the spirit of computer pioneers who turned early relatively closed computer hardware and software into useful and helpful tools to make life better in both small and large ways, I offer this blog on hacking Minecraft.

Will this make life better for you?  My purpose in hacking Minecraft is manifold:  First, and primarily, it is a simple and straight-forward extrapolation of the primary draw of Minecraft -- invention, open-endedness, and exploration -- applied to the Minecraft game itself.  Very meta.  Second, it proved to be a perfect context for learning in much greater technical detail about how Java works.  I've been programming in Java for a while, and knew in generic ways about how the JVM works, but picking through the class file format, reading bytecode, and seeing in concrete terms how the parts of a compiled Java class interact deepened my knowledge and understanding.  This has been much better than textbook learning, because Minecraft is a real-world, non-trivial Java application; it is fairly involved, and clearly suffers from commonplace software problems, such as a design that worked better when the feature-set was smaller.  (Programmers who have worked on corporate software older than, say, 14 minutes will know *exactly* what I mean.)  Thirdly, this has certainly been about making Minecraft more fun.  I find Minecraft to be immensely fun, and I would play it even if I could not hack in my own personal improvments ...  but it is even more enjoyable for me with the tweaks I've introduced.  So my overall hope is that this blog does in fact make your life better -- by providing an enjoyable programming project, by deepening your software engineering skills, and by making Minecraft itself more fun -- in whatever way would add fun for you.

Note that I said "more fun" -- not "easier".  Yes, some of my hacks definitely make getting by in the game easier.  But my crops hack for example makes life for my Minecraft avatar harder.  She (yes, I play as Alex) has to pay much closer attention to the growth cycle of wheat, and both carrots and potatoes are much harder to grow bountifully, because the stages of growth are not as distinct as wheat's.  But this makes the game more fun for her!  ... I mean me!  I play to manage well a growing domain of territory.  I've no interest in slaying the Ender Dragon, nor even visiting the End.  I built a Nether portal so I could gather quartz so that I can eventually craft redstone components.  But I am focused on the Overworld, and am out mostly in the daytime, dealing with mobs only when caught out at night, to mop up after spending all night crafting, or to slay some Endermen for Ender pearls (you'll see why in Chapter 0x0b!).  So I encourage you to apply the hacks of mine that will make gameplay more satisfying for you personally, and to invent hacks of your own that will appeal to your sense of satisfying gameplay.

Besides, there is no challenge in inventing hacks that make Minecraft easy.  For one, there is creative mode.  For another, if you want life to be easy in survival mode, you can just turn on cheats, and get whatever you want whenever you want it.  If you play without cheats turned on (like I do), you aren't inclined to be drawn by the allure of shortcuts in the first place.  And finally, it turns out that mob drops are controlled by plain-text, JSON formatted assets files -- not code.  If you wanted to "hack" it so zombies dropped diamonds instead of rotten flesh, you could do that without touching one byte of logic code.  You could make it so killing mobs supplied you with everything you need to conquer the Minecraft world.  But where's the fun in that?  For me, weakened creepers (hack #1) is mainly about getting rid of a real annoyance : an enemy who can literally appear without warning right behind you and cut all your careful planning short in one blow (or rather, blast).  To me, creepers are a bit unbalanced, at least as the kind of mob that can be among your earliest encounters.  But I'm entirely open to the notion that my feelings here have largely to do with how I prefer to play the game.  Fine by me -- I've simply hacked in what I consider to be a better balance.  If I'm ever inclined to play a more combat-oriented survival game, I'll revert to the stock engine.  But as it is, my hacks are about game balance, and hacks that simply suck the challenge out of the game are just plain pointless.

The last thing I want to note before getting into the hacking itself is that in order to do this, I had to remove Mojang's signature from the Minecraft engine jarfile.  The pristine engine is provided as a signed jarfile, and as a jar, unpacking it is trivial.  Putting it back together after changing it, however, is not impossible I suppose, but computationally infeasible.  The jar contains meta-information that includes the SHA1 hash of each component file.  It's easy enough to recompute those after modifying a classfile or an asset, but then you've changed the SHA1 hash of the meta-information itself.  With that change, the signature on the jarfile no longer fits, and to compute a new one, well, you'd need Mojang's private key.  So.  To put the jar file back together, I simply removed the signature.  This lets it go back together, but no longer as a valid, Mojang-certified game engine.  As a result, I play offline only.  (And I keep a backup of the whole Minecraft directory, in case I accidentally launch it while on-line, and it downloads "updates").

One final, common-sense note of caution: make backups before you begin, and at sensible stages along the way.  That's only prudent, and lets you hack fearlessly, as you will be able to revert to a known-good state if things go haywire.
